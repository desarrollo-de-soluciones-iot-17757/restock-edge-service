# Restock Edge Service

`restock-edge-service` is a lightweight IoT edge API for ingesting telemetry
emitted by Restock smart inventory devices.  The service follows a
Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach and separates device authentication from
telemetry ingestion.

At its current stage, the service provides:

- device authentication using `device_id` + `X-API-Key`
- ingestion of weight measurements from Restock smart scales
- SQLite persistence through Peewee ORM
- timestamp normalization to UTC
- a layered architecture aligned with DDD bounded contexts

## Current Scope

This repository currently implements a focused base version of the edge
service:

- **Implemented**
  - registration/lookup of a development test device
  - authentication of device-originated requests
  - creation and persistence of weight records
  - timestamp normalization to UTC
  - automatic local database bootstrap on first request
- **Not implemented yet**
  - temperature and humidity telemetry
  - anomaly detection
  - device health metrics
  - MQTT integration
  - cloud synchronization with the Restock backend
  - production credential provisioning

Keeping the README aligned with the implemented scope is important in IoT
projects, where firmware contracts and API behavior must remain explicit.

## Why DDD for the Edge Service?

In IoT systems, devices, telemetry, authentication and persistence can evolve
independently.  DDD helps keep the project maintainable by organizing the code
around business capabilities instead of purely technical folders.

This base service is split into two bounded contexts:

### 1. IAM (Identity and Access Management)

Responsible for identifying devices and validating their credentials.

- **Core concept**: `Device`
- **Primary responsibility**: authenticate incoming requests from Restock IoT
  devices

### 2. Tracking

Responsible for validating and storing telemetry.

- **Core concept**: `WeightRecord`
- **Primary responsibility**: accept weight readings and persist them locally

The Tracking context depends on IAM only for device validation, which keeps the
telemetry model decoupled from authentication details.

## Layered Architecture

Each bounded context follows the same DDD-inspired structure:

- **Domain**
  - entities and domain services
  - business rules and invariants
  - no framework or ORM concerns
- **Application**
  - orchestration of use cases
  - coordination of repositories and domain services
- **Infrastructure**
  - Peewee models
  - repository implementations
  - persistence details
- **Interfaces**
  - Flask HTTP endpoints and request handling

## Technology Stack

- Python 3.13+
- Flask
- Peewee
- SQLite
- python-dateutil

Exact Python dependencies are declared in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt).

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a virtual environment

```sh
python -m venv .venv
```

Windows:

```sh
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Linux/macOS:

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the service

```sh
python app.py
```

The Flask application runs in debug mode when started this way.

## Runtime Behavior

The application performs bootstrap work before serving the first request:

- initializes the SQLite database
- creates the `devices` and `weight_records` tables if they do not exist
- seeds a development test device if absent

Database initialization is triggered by the Flask `before_request` hook, so the
setup occurs on the first incoming HTTP request handled by the process.

## Development Test Device

For local development, the application seeds the following device if it is not
already present in the database:

- `device_id`: `restock-scale-001`
- `api_key`: `test-api-key-123`

> [!WARNING]
> These credentials are hard-coded for local development only. Do not reuse
> them in production or on real IoT deployments.

## API Contract

### Create a weight record

`POST /api/v1/tracking/weight-records`

Creates a new weight telemetry record for an authenticated Restock device.

#### Required headers

- `Content-Type: application/json`
- `X-API-Key: <device api key>`

#### Request body

```json
{
  "device_id": "restock-scale-001",
  "weight": 1200.5,
  "created_at": "2026-05-25T12:00:00-05:00"
}
```

#### Request fields

- `device_id` (`string`, required): unique device identifier
- `weight` (`number`, required): measured weight expressed in grams
- `created_at` (`string`, optional): ISO 8601 timestamp; when omitted, the
  service uses the current UTC time

#### Example request

```sh
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/tracking/weight-records \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-API-Key: test-api-key-123' \
  -d '{
    "device_id": "restock-scale-001",
    "weight": 1200.5,
    "created_at": "2026-05-25T12:00:00-05:00"
  }'
```

#### Success response

`201 Created`

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "device_id": "restock-scale-001",
  "weight": 1200.5,
  "created_at": "2026-05-25T17:00:00+00:00"
}
```

#### Error responses

- `400 Bad Request`
  - missing required fields
  - invalid weight value
  - malformed timestamp
- `401 Unauthorized`
  - missing `device_id`
  - missing `X-API-Key`
  - invalid device/API key pair

## Operational Notes for IoT Projects

When adapting this service for a real IoT deployment, consider the following:

- **Credential management**: replace hard-coded development credentials with a
  secure enrollment or provisioning flow.
- **Persistence**: SQLite is suitable for local development and lightweight
  edge deployments, but not ideal for high-write concurrency.
- **Observability**: add structured logging, trace correlation and a dedicated
  health check endpoint before production use.
- **Device contracts**: version telemetry payloads carefully so firmware and
  server-side ingestion remain compatible.
- **Startup lifecycle**: move bootstrap logic out of `before_request` if you
  need deterministic initialization during container startup.
